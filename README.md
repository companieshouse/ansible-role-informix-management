## Role Variables

The following role variables are required, however default values may be used where applicable:

| Name                                    | Default    | Description                                            |
|-----------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `informix_management_alerts_enabled`    | `no`       | A boolean value representing whether to enable the retrieval of alerts config from Hashicorp Vault. If enabled (i.e. set to `yes`), configuration will be retrieved from Hashicorp Vault using the path specified by the `informix_management_alerts_vault_path` variable. This configuration will be stored in a variable named `informix_management_alerts_config` and can be referened in Jinja2 templates installed from the path specified by the `informix_management_script_templates_path` variable. |
| `informix_management_alerts_vault_path` |            | The Hashicorp Vault path to read alerts configuration from when `informix_management_alerts_enabled` is true. This information is made accessible to Jinja2 template scripts installed from the `informix_management_script_templates_path` path, using the template variable `informix_management_alerts_config`. |
| `informix_management_cron_jobs`         |            | See [Informix Cron Jobs][2] for more information.      |
| `informix_management_informix_group`    | `informix` | The group to be used for ownership of script files, directories, and cron jobs. |
| `informix_management_informix_user`     | `informix` | The user to be used for ownership of script files and directories. |
| `informix_management_install_path`      | `/opt/informix/14.10` | The path to the Informix installation directory. |
| `informix_management_logs_path`         | `/var/log/informix/common` | The path to a directory which will be created for storing the output of cron job scripts. |
| `informix_management_script_templates_path` |            | A path to a directory containing one or more [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/) format template script files. These scripts will be installed to `/home/{{ informix_management_informix_user }}/scripts/` and can be executed as cron jobs. See [Informix Cron Jobs][2] for more information. |
| `informix_management_stats_enabled`     | `no`       | A boolean value representing whether to enable the retrieval of stats config from Hashicorp Vault. If enabled (i.e. set to `yes`), configuration will be retrieved from Hashicorp Vault using the path specified by the `informix_management_stats_vault_path` variable. This configuration will be stored in a variable named `informix_management_stats_config` and can be referened in Jinja2 templates installed from the path specified by the `informix_management_script_templates_path` variable. |
| `informix_management_stats_vault_path`  |            | The Hashicorp Vault path to read stats configuration from when `informix_management_stats_enabled` is true. This information is made accessible to Jinja2 template scripts installed from the `informix_management_script_templates_path` path, using the template variable `informix_management_stats_config`. |

### Informix Cron Jobs

The `informix_management_cron_jobs` variable can be used to schedule cron jobs for the user defined by the `informix_management_informix_user` variable. This is primarily used to perform level zero and continuous logical log backups for Informix databases. If unset, _no_ cron jobs will be configured. This variable should be defined as a list, and each item in this list represents a single cron job for the Informix user defined by the variable `informix_management_informix_user`. The following parameters are required for each item in the list:

| Name                 | Default | Description                                                                          |
|----------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`               |         | A description of the job. This parameter should be unique across all jobs defined for a given group. |
| `day_of_week`        |         | Day of the week that the job should run (`0-6` for Sunday-Saturday, `*`, and so on). |
| `day_of_month`       |         | Day of the month the job should run (`1-31`, `*`, `*/2`, and so on).                 |
| `minute`             |         | Minute when the job should run (`0-59`, `*`, `*/2`, and so on).                      |
| `hour`               |         | Hour when the job should run (`0-23`, `*`, `*/2`, and so on).                        |
| `script`             |         | The name of the script to execute. A Jinja2 template for this script is expected to exist within the directory specified by the `informix_management_script_templates_path` variable, with a `.j2` extension. The `script` parameter value should not include the `.j2` file extension.

> [!TIP]
> Template script files in the directory specified by the `informix_management_script_templates_path` variable may use role variables to determine if certain role features have been enabled. This is used primarily to control whether alerts and stats generation are performed in particularl scripts, for example by checking the boolean value of the variable `informix_management_stats_enabled`, and then using the `informix_management_stats_config` variable (itself )


For example, to execute the `level_zero_backup` script at midnight every day, passing the script the single argument `ef`:

```yaml
informix_management_cron_jobs:
  - name: Perform level zero backup for EF database
    day_of_week: "*"
    day_of_month: "*"
    minute: "0"
    hour: "0"
    script: "level_zero_backup ef"
```

##Â Interactive Menu

An interactive shell function named `menu` will be installed by this role, and the `.bash_profile` configuration file for the user specified by the `informix_management_informix_user` variable will be updated to automatically execute this function when a new shell is created. The menu presented to the user will include an option for each database server configuration on the host, and when an option is selected the current shell will be configured for that specific database server. This is intended for use with tools like `dbaccess`, which require configuration to be present in the environment to konw which server to access. The menu can be invoked at any time by executing the `menu` function on the command-line, and will reconfigure the current shell for the database server selected by the user.
